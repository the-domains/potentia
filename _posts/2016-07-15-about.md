# About

_Potentia_ is an applied research, open source think tank. The mission is to democratize research, and solve the world's most nagging and devastating problems, by open collaboration between academic researchers and social and political policy decision makers, but more importantly, and uniquely, we plan to solve our world's problems through open collaboration with the public. We are rethinking the model of traditional think tanks, which are populated by a decidedly exclusive group of elite researchers, yet highly influential in policies that affect the masses. We will open up the discussion by bringing together academic researchers with the public to discuss, research and design solutions to our world's most overwhelming social issues; and then work with political, business, and social leaders to disseminate and implement research findings.
